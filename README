ncdc 0.6g
========

DESCRIPTION

  ncdc aims to become an awesome Direct Connect client with an NCurses
  interface, written in C. It is currently still in active development, and
  therefore lacks many features you'd expect a mature direct connect client to
  have. Nonetheless, ncdc is already quite useful.

  Always make sure you run the latest version. You can check for updates and
  find more information at http://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdc



REQUIREMENTS


  ncursesw
  bzip2
  gdbm
  glib2
  libxml2



BUILDING FROM A RELEASE TARBALL

  If you managed to fetch an ncdc tarball from somewhere, then you will need
  the following to build ncdc:
  - A C compiler
  - GNU make
  - Header files for the above REQUIREMENTS

  And the usual commands will get you up and running:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    make (or gmake)
    (sudo) make install



BUILDING FROM THE GIT REPOSITORY

  To build the latest and greatest version from the git repository, you will
  need the stuff mentioned above in addition to:
  - GNU autotools
  - The 'makeheaders' program, which is assumed to be in your $PATH
    (Get it from http://www.hwaci.com/sw/mkhdr/index.html)

  Then run the following command:

    autoreconf -i

  ...and you can use same tricks to build ncdc as with using a release tarball.
