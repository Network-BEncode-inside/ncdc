ncdc 0.1-alpha
==============

DESCRIPTION

  ncdc aims to become an awesome Direct Connect client with an NCurses
  interface, written in C. It is currently in a very early alpha stage and
  nothing useful has been implemented yet.


REQUIREMENTS


  ncursesw
  bzip2
  gdbm
  glib2
  libxml2



BUILDING

  To build ncdc from this repository (there are no packaged versions yet), you
  will need the following:

  - GNU make and autotools
  - A C compiler, obviously
  - Header files for the above REQUIREMENTS
  - The 'makeheaders' program, which is assumed to be in your $PATH
    (Get it from http://www.hwaci.com/sw/mkhdr/index.html)

  If you have all that, run:

    autoreconf -i
    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    make (or gmake)

  And optionally 'make install' if you want.
