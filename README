ncdc 1.7g
========

DESCRIPTION

  ncdc is a modern and lightweight direct connect client with a friendly
  ncurses interface.

  Always make sure you run the latest version. You can check for updates and
  find more information at http://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdc



REQUIREMENTS


  ncursesw
  bzip2
  sqlite3
  glib2
  libxml2

  To enable TLS support, make sure you compile with glib version 2.28 or
  higher, and that glib-networking is installed at run-time.
  If you are upgrading from version 1.5 or earlier, you will also need gdbm in
  order to build the ncdc-db-upgrade utility.



BUILDING FROM A RELEASE TARBALL

  If you managed to fetch an ncdc tarball from somewhere, then you will need
  the following to build ncdc:
  - A C compiler
  - GNU make
  - Header files for the above REQUIREMENTS

  And the usual commands will get you up and running:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    make (or gmake)
    (sudo) make install



BUILDING FROM THE GIT REPOSITORY

  To build the latest and greatest version from the git repository, you will
  need the stuff mentioned above in addition to:
  - GNU autotools
  - The 'makeheaders' program, which is assumed to be in your $PATH
    (Get it from http://www.hwaci.com/sw/mkhdr/index.html)

  Then run the following command:

    autoreconf -i

  ...and you can use same tricks to build ncdc as with using a release tarball.
