ncdc 0.1-alpha
==============

DESCRIPTION

  ncdc aims to become an awesome Direct Connect client with an NCurses
  interface, written in C. It is currently in a very early alpha stage and
  nothing useful has been implemented yet.


REQUIREMENTS


  ncursesw
  glib2



BUILDING

  To build ncdc from this repository (there are no packaged versions yet), you
  will need the following:

  - autotools and make and stuff
  - A C compiler, obviously
  - ncurses & glib development files
  - The 'makeheaders' program, which is assumed to be in your $PATH
    (Get it from http://www.hwaci.com/sw/mkhdr/index.html - In future versions
    I'll probably include that program in repo, it's only a single C file.)

  If you have all that, run:

    autoreconf -i
    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    make

  And optionally 'make install' if you want.
