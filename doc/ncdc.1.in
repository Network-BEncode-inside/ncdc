.SH NAME
ncdc \- Ncurses Direct Connect Client

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ncdc
.RI [ option... ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Ncdc is a modern and lightweight direct connect client with a friendly ncurses
interface.

.SH GETTING STARTED
This is a basic introduction for those who are new to ncdc. See the chapters
below for a more detailed description of the available functionality.
.PP
What you see when starting up ncdc is an input line where you can input
commands and a log window where the results are displayed, much like a regular
terminal. Commands within ncdc start with a slash (e.g. `/help') and have
tab completion to help you.
.PP
The first thing you will want to do after starting ncdc for the first time is
to setup some basic information and settings:
.br
  /set nick \fBMyNick\fP
.br
  /set description \fBncdc is awesome!\fP
.br
  /set connection \fB10\fP
.br
  /share \fB"My Awesome Files" /path/to/files\fP
.PP
And if you have a direct connection to the internet or if your router allows
port forwarding, you may also want to enable active mode:
.br
  /set active_ip \fB13.33.33.7\fP
.br
  /set active_port \fB34194\fP
.br
  /set active \fBtrue\fP
.PP
See the help text for each of the commands and settings for more information.
Of course, all of the above settings are saved to the database and will be used
again on the next run.
.PP
To connect to a hub, use /open:
.br
  /open \fBncdc adc://dc.blicky.net:2780/\fP
.br
Here `ncdc' is the personal name you give to the hub, and the second argument
the URL. This URL will be saved in the database, so the next time you want to
connect to this hub, you can simply do:
.br
  /open \fBncdc\fP
.br
See the help text for '/open' and '/connect' for more information. If you want
to automatically connect to a hub when ncdc starts up, use the `autoconnect'
setting.
.PP
Ncdc uses a tabbed interface: every hub opens in a new tab, and there are
several other kinds of tabs available as well. The type of tab is indicated in
the tab list on the bottom of the screen with a character prefix. Hubs, for
example, are prefixed with a `#'. If a tab needs your attention, a colored
exclamation mark is displayed before the tab name, different colors are used
for different types of activity.
.PP
Everything else should be fairly self-explanatory: To search for files, use the
`/search' command. To browse through the user list of a hub, use `/userlist' or
hit Alt+u. To browse someone's file list, use `/browse' or hit the 'b' key in
the user list. And to monitor your upload and download connections, use
`/connections' or hit Alt+n.

.SH OPTIONS

@commands@

.SH SETTINGS
The following is a list of configuration settings. These settings can be
changed and queried using the `/set' command, and are stored in the db.sqlite3
file in the session directory.
@settings@

.SH KEY BINDINGS
On any tab without the text input line, you can press `?' to get the key
bindings for that tab. The list of key bindings is available through the
`/help keys' command, and is reproduced below.
@keys@

.SH ENVIRONMENT
$NCDC_DIR is used to determine the session dir, it is only honoured if \fB-c\fP
is not set on the command line.

.SH FILES
$NCDC_DIR corresponds to the session dir set via -c, environment variable
$NCDC_DIR or $HOME/.ncdc.
.TP
.I $NCDC_DIR/cert/
Directory where the client certificates are stored. Must contain a private key
file (client.key) and public certificate (client.crt). These should be
generated automatically when ncdc starts up the first time, but can be
generated manually using ncdc-gen-cert(1).
.TP
.I $NCDC_DIR/db.sqlite3
The database. This stores all configuration variables, hash data of shared
files, download queue information and other state information. Manually editing
this file with the `sqlite3' commandline tool is possible but discouraged. Any
changes made to the database while ncdc is running will not be read, and may
even get overwritten by ncdc.
.TP
.I $NCDC_DIR/dl/
Directory where completed downloads are moved to by default. Can be changed
with the `download_dir' configuration option.
.TP
.I $NCDC_DIR/files.xml.bz2
Filelist containing a listing of all shared files.
.TP
.I $NCDC_DIR/fl/
Directory where downloaded file lists from other users are stored. The names of
the files are hex-encoded user IDs that are used internally by ncdc. Old file
lists are deleted automatically after a configurable interval. See the
`filelist_maxage' configuration option.
.TP
.I $NCDC_DIR/history
Command history.
.TP
.I $NCDC_DIR/inc/
Default location for incomplete downloads. Can be changed with the
`incoming_dir' setting. The file names in this directory are the base32-encoded
TTH root of the completed file.
.TP
.I $NCDC_DIR/logs/
Directory where all the log files are stored. File names starting with `#' are
hub logs and `~' are user (PM) logs. Special log files are transfers.log and
main.log.
.br
ncdc does not have built-in functionality to rotate or compress log files
automatically. When rotating log files manually (e.g. via a cron job), make
sure to send the SIGUSR1 signal afterwards to force ncdc to flush the old logs
and create or open the new log files.
.TP
.I $NCDC_DIR/stderr.log
Error/debug log. This file is cleared every time ncdc starts up.
.TP
.I $NCDC_DIR/version
Version of the data directory. This file locked while an ncdc instance is
running, making sure that no two ncdc instances work with the same session
directory at the same time.
