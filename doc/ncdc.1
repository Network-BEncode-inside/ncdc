.SH DESCRIPTION
Ncdc is a modern and lightweight direct connect client with a friendly ncurses
interface. 

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-session-dir=<dir>
.br
Use a different session directory. Defaults to the contents of the environment
variable `$NCDC_DIR' or if this is unset to `$HOME/.ncdc'.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
.br
Display summary of options.
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-no\-autoconnect
.br
Don't automatically connect to hubs with the `autoconnect' option set.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version

.SH ENVIRONMENT 
$NCDC_DIR is used to determine the session dir, it is only honoured if \fB-c\fP
is not set on the command line.

.SH FILES
$NCDC_DIR corresponds to the session dir set via -c, environment variable
$NCDC_DIR or $HOME/.ncdc.
.TP
.I $NCDC_DIR/cert/
Directory where the client certificates are stored. Must contain a private key
file (client.key) and public certificate (client.crt). These should be
generated automatically when ncdc starts up the first time, but can be
generated manually using ncdc-gen-cert(1).
.TP
.I $NCDC_DIR/config.ini
Main configuration file. It is recommended to use commands within ncdc instead
of editing this file manually. In particular, do not edit this file while ncdc
is running, otherwise you will lose your changes. 
.TP
.I $NCDC_DIR/dl/
Directory where completed downloads are moved to by default. Can be changed
with the `download_dir' configuration option.
.TP
.I $NCDC_DIR/dl.dat
Stores information about the download queue.
.TP
.I $NCDC_DIR/files.xml.bz2
Filelist containing a listing of all shared files.
.TP
.I $NCDC_DIR/fl/
Directory where downloaded file lists from other users are stored. The names of
the files are hex-encoded user IDs that are used internally by ncdc. Old file
lists are deleted automatically after one week.
.TP
.I $NCDC_DIR/hashdata.dat
File information and hash data for shared files.
.TP
.I $NCDC_DIR/history
Command history.
.TP
.I $NCDC_DIR/inc/
Location for incomplete downloads. File names are the base32-encoded TTH root
of the completed file.
.TP
.I $NCDC_DIR/logs/
Directory where all the log files are stored. File names starting with `#' are
hub logs and `~' are user (PM) logs. Special log files are transfers.log and
main.log.
.br
ncdc does not have built-in functionality to rotate or compress log files
automatically. When rotating log files manually (e.g. via a cron job), make
sure to send the SIGUSR1 signal afterwards to force ncdc to flush the old logs
and create or open the new log files.
.TP
.I $NCDC_DIR/stderr.log
Error/debug log. This file is cleared every time ncdc starts up.
.TP
.I $NCDC_DIR/version
Version of the data directory. This file locked while an ncdc instance is
running, making sure that no two ncdc instances work with the same session
directory at the same time.
