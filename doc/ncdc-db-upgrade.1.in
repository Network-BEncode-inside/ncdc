.SH NAME
ncdc-db-upgrade \- Upgrade the ncdc session directory to a later version

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ncdc-db-upgrade
[-c directory] [--backup]

.SH DESCRIPTION
ncdc-db-upgrade will upgrade a session directory in the format used by older
versions of ncdc to the format used in later versions. Specifically, it will
allow you to upgrade to ncdc 1.6 and later without losing the data and
configuration you had with version 1.5 or earlier.

The path to the session directory can be given with the -c argument. If this
argument is not given or empty, $NCDC_DIR or "$HOME/.ncdc" will be used
instead. This is equivalent to the behaviour of ncdc(1).
